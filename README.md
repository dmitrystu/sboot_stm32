### Secure USB DFU1.1 bootloader for STM32
#### Features
+ Small size. Fits in 4K ROM segment (ASM or no encription, otherwise a bit more).
+ USB DFU1.1 compatible
+ supports by [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)
+ Supports one of the following ciphers
  + No encryption
  + ARCFOUR stream cipher
  + CHACHA20 stream cipher (C and ASM implementation)
  + RC5-32/12/128 block cipher in CBC mode (C and ASM implementation)
  + GOST R 34.12-2015 "MAGMA" block cipher in CBC mode
  + RAIDEN block cipher in CBC mode
  + SPECK 64/128 block cipher in CBC mode
  + XTEA (classic and XTEA-1) block cipher in CBC mode
  + BLOWFISH block cipher in CBC mode
+ Different interfaces for flash and eeprom programming
+ Autoseal using RDP level 1 or 2 (prevents reading decrypted FW trough debug interface).
  Be careful when you set RDP to level 2. This operation is irreversible and disables
  all debug functions and option bytes programming.
+ Software for firmaware encryption/decription included
+ Supported STM32 family
  + STM32L0x2
  + STM32L1xx
  + STM32L476xx (OTG FS in device mode)
  + STM32F103
  + STM32F105, STM32F107 (OTG FS in device mode)

#### Usage:

#### Adjusting user firmware
+ check bootloader's linker map for the ````__app_start```` address. This is the new ROM origin for the user firmware (isr vectors).
+ Adjust your linker script to set new ROM origin and ROM length

#### Utilizing usbd core and usbd driver from bootloader in the user firmware
+ check bootloader's linker map for the ````usbd_poll```` entry point and usbd driver (````usbd_devfs````, ````usbd_otgfs````, e.t.c. depends used MCU). It's located just after ```.isr_vector``` section
+ add address for usbd_driver structure to your linker script. For example ````usbd_drv    = 0x08000040;````
+ add address for usbd_poll entry point to your linker script. For example ````usbd_poll   = 0x08000074;````
+ add ````extern struct usbd_driver usbd_drv;```` driver declaration to your code
+ include at least "usbd_core.h" and "usb_std.h" to your code

Now you can use usbd core and driver from bootloader in your application. Don't forget to set GPIO and RCC for USB according to MCU requirements.

#### Activating bootloader
+ put DFU_BOOTKEY on DFU_BOOTKEY_ADDR (RAM top by default) and make a software reset
+ by DFU_BOOTSTRAP_PIN on DFU_BOOTSTRAP_PORT on startup (optional)
+ make a double reset in DFU_DBLRESET_MS period (optional)

#### Encryption/Decryption user firmware
At this moment only binary files supported

To encrypt:
````
fwcrypt -e infile.bin outfile.bin
````
To decrypt:
````
fwcrypt -d infile.bin outfile.bin
````
